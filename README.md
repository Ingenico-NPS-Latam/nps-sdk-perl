Nps SDK allows you to log whatâ€™s happening with you request inside of our SDK, it logs by default to stout.

If you have the debug option enabled, the sdk can write the output generated from the logger to the file you provided.

```perl

```

The logging.INFO level will write concise information of the request and will mask sensitive data of the request. 
The logging.DEBUG level will write information about the request to let developers debug it in a more detailed way.

```perl

Sanitize allows the SDK to truncate to a fixed size some fields that could make request fail, like extremely long name.
